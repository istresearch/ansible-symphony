GDK Setup
==========

This guide is about setting up the GDK laptop and deploying a Pulse instance to a VM on the laptop. The deployment process uses Vagrant files and Ansible playbooks in the **ansible-symphony-ist** repository. This document should be used in conjunction with the :doc:`pulse_deployment` guide in the **ansible-symphony-ist** documentation.
