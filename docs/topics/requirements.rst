Requirements
============

The software requirements to run this Ansible code are:

- Unix based machine (Linux, MacOSx)
- Ansible version 2.x
- Vagrant >= 1.8.1
- VirtualBox >= 5.0.12
  
Everything may also work with VMWare as a VM provider for Vagrant, although it has not been tested.

**Ubuntu Trusty 14.04** is used as the default base image for VM creation.  Support for **CentOS 6.5** is deprecated, although the code for RedHat based Linux variants is still available in some roles for reference.
